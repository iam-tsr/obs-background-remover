## OBS - Background Remover [In Progress]

An initiative to support creators and streamers who use Linux operating systems, with a focus on providing high-quality tools to simplify their workflows through this project.

Currently, this project is standalone and supports <u>only Fedora’s Wayland version</u>.

Our ongoing development aims to continually enhance the model and user experience while optimizing system resource usage.
​
### Features

The current version introduces a virtual camera with real-time background blur that can be used as a source in OBS Studio. We acknowledge that installation is not seamless yet; although packaging options like Flatpak are under consideration, this release is intended solely for testing.

Refer to [QUICKSTART](QUICKSTART.md) for installation guidance.
